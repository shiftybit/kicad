# Circuitry Projects
This is primarily a repository created for me to keep track of all my misc electronics project in one place. In here you will find kicad projects and libraries, misc arduino sketches, cherry tree notebooks (though these will be converted to markdown in the near future.

## Circuit Atlanta ToDo List
- [ ] Identify list of buildings to make.
- [ ] Use icarus board to identify addressable led strategy. 

## Circuit Atlanta Buildings
- [ ] AT&T Building (partially complete)
	- [x] SVG Reference
	- [x] Logo
	- [x] Windows
	- [ ] Scale, Size, and Dimensions
		- In order to scale, I need to have other buildings available. 
- [ ] Westin
	- This building is difficult due to it's cylindrical shape, and the fact that the entire thing is glass. 
	- The nature of the entire building being glass means that my discrete led lighting technique will look considerably more ugly
	- This also presents the problem of having no discrete windows.
	- Could use a black board for this, and only light a few windows. 
- [ ] Bank of America Building
	- I'm curious about how to do the top here.
	- Current plan is to do naked FR4 material and use basic LEDS mounted behind the FR4 to diffuse the orange/yellowish light through the substrate material. 
		- I could investigate other substrate materials here to achieve a different effect. 
- [ ] SunTrust Plaza
	- This building is my favorite building in atlanta, and I think I will have the most fun with this.
	- It seems relatively simple. 
- [ ] Georgia Pacific Building
	- Also seems pretty easy.
- [ ] Equitable building
	- Super simple building. Plus big identifable logo. Win Win

This leaves me a total of 6 buildings for a skyline. I feel like I need at least 9 to make the skyline easily identifiable. I want somebody seeing this peice of art to immediately know this is atlanta. It needs to be iconic and recognizable.
